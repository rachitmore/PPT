By introducing slack variables, we allow the SVM model to make some errors on the training data, at a cost determined by the C-parameter. The slack variables measure the distance by which a data point is on the wrong side of the decision boundary, and the goal of the SVM model becomes to find a decision boundary that separates the data with the maximum margin while minimizing the sum of the slack variables."
