One such algorithm is the Naive Bayes classifier, which is a simple supervised machine learning algorithm that uses Bayes’ theorem with strong independence assumptions between the features to procure results. It is a probabilistic classifier, which means it predicts on the basis of the probability of an object. Some popular examples of Naive Bayes Algorithm are spam filtration, Sentimental analysis, and classifying articles. "

    "Cross-validation is a technique used in machine learning to evaluate the performance of a model on unseen data. It involves dividing the available data into multiple folds or subsets, using one of these folds as a validation set, and training the model on the remaining folds. This process is repeated multiple times, each time using a different fold as the validation set. Finally, the results from each validation step are averaged to produce a more robust estimate of the model’s performance.\n",

    "The main purpose of cross-validation is to prevent overfitting, which occurs when a model is trained too well on the training data and performs poorly on new, unseen data. By evaluating the model on multiple validation sets, cross-validation provides a more realistic estimate of the model’s generalization performance, i.e., its ability to perform well on new, unseen data.\n",

    "There are several types of cross-validation techniques, including k-fold cross-validation, leave-one-out cross-validation, and stratified cross-validation. The choice of technique depends on the size and nature of the data, as well as the specific requirements of the modeling problem."
